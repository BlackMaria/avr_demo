/*
 * Code to read in data from two daisychained 74HC165 PISO shift registers.
 * 
 * The SN74HC165 is an 8-bit parallel-load shift register that, when clocked, 
 * shift the data toward a serial (QH) output. Parallel-in access to each 
 * stage is provided by eight individual direct data (Aâˆ’H) inputs that are 
 * enabled by a low level at the shift/load (SH/LD) input. The SN74HC165 also 
 * features a clock-inhibit (CLK INH) function and a complementary serial (QH) 
 * output.
 *
 * Clocking is accomplished by a low-to-high transition of the clock (CLK) 
 * input while SH/LD is held high and CLK INH is held low. The functions of 
 * CLK and CLK  INH are interchangeable. Since a low CLK and a low-to-high 
 * transition of CLK  INH also accomplish clocking, CLK INH should be changed 
 * to the high level only while CLK is high. Parallel loading is inhibited 
 * when SH/LD is held high. While SH/LD is low, the parallel inputs to the
 * register are enabled independently of the levels of the CLK, CLK INH, or 
 * serial (SER) input
